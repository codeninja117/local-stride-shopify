            "answer": "<p>Yes! And in many ways better. The 3D imaging system on your smartphone is exactly what is used in many podiatry clinics every day to scan feet for custom orthotics. Because only the front camera is capable of using this technology, clinicians need awkward angles or mirror attachments to capture scans. However, we have found that letting the patient scan their own feet is more ergonomic and gets better results. Also, you can do it yourself, at home! Of course, your scans will be reviewed by trained clinicians and also be processed through AI optimization to ensure the absolute best fit.</p>"

They also can relieve pain from pressure centers on your feet and improve athletic performance through posture and alignment correction. Simply tell us what condition you have and our podiatrists will build your orthotic for your condition. If you don't know what you have (if anything), your foot images and intake form will help us determine the proper adjustments to get your optimal fit.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>Different foot conditions respond at different speeds to orthotic correction. Our cushioned lining and arch support should provide immediate relief for most causes of pain. However, during the corrective process, under-activated muscles and tissues in your feet may cause some initial soreness as your body begins to restore their function. Don't worry, this is completely normal and shows the orthotic is working!</p>"

We have gotten rid of that antiquated practice in exchange for modern 3D scanning for a few key reasons: 1: It takes too much time. Instead of getting rid of your pain, you are waiting days for the box to arrive and then get back to them 2: It's messy. The foam will get all over your foot and the ground 3: It's inaccurate. It's very difficult, if not impossible to get a even impression on your left and right foot without the help of a medical professional.</p>"
